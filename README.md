MCTS AI for Tic Tac Toe

This project exists so I have a playground to explore two concepts I want to
get more familiar with. The one concept is doing non-trivial programming work
in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The other concept is to explore [Monte
Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search).
